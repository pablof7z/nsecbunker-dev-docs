# Commit

Commit is a [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com) site template built using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

## Getting started

To get started, first install dependencies via npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` environment variable to your site's public URL:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://example.com
```

Then start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.

## Customizing

We've tried to build this template exactly the same way we'd build it if it we were building a real website, so there's no weird configuration files or global variables like you might see in a product that has been built as a "theme" rather than as an actual site.

Instead, you make changes by just opening the files you want to change, and changing whatever it is you want to change.

We'll cover a lot of the fundamentals here to help you get going quickly, but at the end of the day the whole codebase is yours and you should feel free to edit everything directly as much as you need to.

### Project structure

The template is built as a pretty standard Next.js website, but using the `src` folder so things like the `pages` directory are located at `./src/pages` instead of being top-level.

### Title and metadata

You can update your site's `<title>` and metadata in `./src/pages/_app.jsx`.

### Hero content

The main hero section for the site that includes your logo, headline, description, and links are all located in `./src/components/Intro.jsx`.

### Adding changelog entries

All of the changelog entries are stored in one big `./src/pages/index.mdx` file. We were inspired to set it up this way by how projects commonly maintain plaintext `CHANGELOG` files, and thought it would be cool to parse this sort of format and turn it into a nicely designed site.

Each changelog entry should be separated by a horizontal rule (`---`) and should include an `<h2>` with a date, specified as an [MDX annotation](https://github.com/bradlc/mdx-annotations):

```md
---

Your content...
```

### Newsletter

You can find the newsletter sign up form in `./src/components/SignUpForm.jsx` â€” if you have a newsletter you'll want to wire this up with whatever mailing list software you use to get it to actually work.

### RSS feed

The site will automatically generate an RSS feed at build time based on the content of `./src/pages/index.mdx`.

You can edit the metadata for the feed (like the title and description) in `./src/lib/generateRssFeed.js`.

Make sure to set your `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` environment variable as the RSS feed needs this to generate the correct links for each entry.
