## Why remote signing {{ date: '2023-06-07T00:00Z' }}

nsecBunker (through NIP-46) allows for your users to assign specific permissions to your application, without ever granting you their nsec.

Now, why would you want to do this?

I mean, does it really even need describing? Do you really want the responsibility of having your users' nsec in your
code? What if a bug in your code leaks your users' nsecs? I don't know about you, but, to me, that sounds like a nightmare.

## Signers {{ date: '2023-06-06T00:00Z' }}

Signing via an nsecBunker requires <b>two</b> NDK Signers:

* a local signer
* a remote signer

## Local Signer

A local signer is an application key that is NOT tied to the user. The user might as well never see this key.

This *local* key is the one that will be signing requests for nsecBunker to sign.

> A local key doesn't publish events for normal consumption, but rather, it solely exists to communicate with an nsecBunker.

### Generating a local signer

The following code will generate a new private key.

```typescript
const localSigner = NDKPrivateKeySigner.generate()
```

When creating a real integration, you would want to store this private key. Your users will be granting permissions to
this key, so you'll want to reuse this key across your user sessions when it makes sense to do so.

### Loading a local signer with a saved private key
If you have already saved a local key you would load it instead, obviously.

```typescript
const privateKey = localStorage.getItem('localSignerPrivateKey');
const localSigner = new NDKPrivateKeySigner(privateKey);
```

### Loading the remote signer

The remote signer is a `NDKNip46Signer`, which communicates with the nsecBunker (over nostr relays, obviously) to exchange event signatures and other things.

### Target pubkey

The next and final thing we'll need is the remote pubkey we desired to sign as. We'll ask the user in some way
what's the pubkey they want to sign as.

```
const desiredPubkeyOrToken = prompt(`Enter your npub or token`);
```

### Token
What's that token thing? Is it a shitcoin? Nah.

A token is a one-time-use secret that users can configure in their nsecBunker to confer a set of permissions
to an application. For example, a user might give your application permission to only sign kind:1 events, but not
kind:0 events.

### Communicating with the nsecBunker
Since the remote signer is accessed via Nostr, we use an `NDK` instance to communicate with it.

Now, you can either use the same NDK instance you use for all other nostr communications but, for now, I choose to create a dedicated NDK instance that will just be used to communicate with the nsecBunker.

```typescript
const bunkerNDK = new NDK({
  explicitRelayUrls: [
    'wss://relay.nsecbunker.com',
    'wss://nostr.vulpem.com',
  ]
})
bunkerNDK.connect(2000);

const remoteSigner = new NDKNip46Signer(bunkerNDK, desiredPubkeyOrToken, localSigner);
```

Now that we have both our signers, let's create the generic NDK instance we're going to be using to
communicate for normal nostr usage.

```typescript
const typicalNDK = new NDK({
  explicitRelayUrls: [
    'wss://relay.damus.io',
    'wss://nos.lol',
    // ...
  ],
  signer: remoteSigner
})
```

We're going to pass in to this NDK instance the remote signer.
